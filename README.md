# Fashion MNIST Classifier

This is a deep learning web application that classifies images of fashion items using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The app is built with Python and Streamlit.

## Project Overview

The model is trained to recognize the following clothing categories:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

You can upload a JPG or PNG image of a fashion item, and the app will predict its category.
